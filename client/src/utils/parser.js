 * The functions parses the data which is fetched from four different routes

 * This parsed object is later sent down from the presenter to the view. 
 * 
 * @param {Object} data the data to be parsed contains all data related to the current air quality
 * @param {Object} data.gases, the object which contains the most recent reading on carbon and volatile gases as well as when it was measured.
 * @param {Object} data.gases["date"], the date and time of when volatile gases and carbon was measured.
 * @param {Object} data.gases["data"].carbon, the current carbon value in the room measured in ppm.
 * @param {Object} data.gases["data"].volatile, the current number of volatile gases in the room, measured in ppb.
 * @param {Object} data.tempData, contains the most recent temperature reading and when it was measured.
 * @param {Object} data.tempData["date"], the date and time of when temperature was measured.
 * @param {Object} data.tempData["data"].temperature, the current temperature in the room. 
 * @param {Object} data.humidityData, contains the most recent humidity reading and when it was measured. 
 * @param {Object} data.humidityData["date"], the date and time of when the humidity was measured.
 * @param {Object} data.humidityData["data"].humidity, the most recent humidity reading
 * @returns {Object} an object which contains all data related to Air Quality.
